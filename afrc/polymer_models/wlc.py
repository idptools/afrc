    This class generates an object that returns polymer statistics consistent with the Worm-like chain
    model as implemented by Zhou (2004).

    This model should be basically identical to the O'Brien model (WormLikeChain2) but show better
    numerical stability at large contour lengths. Unlike the O'Brien model this model does not
    provide an estimation of the mean Rg.
