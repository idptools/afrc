    This class generates an object that returns polymer statistics consistent with a 
    self-avoiding random walk (SAW). This model was developed by Jhulian 'J' Alston,
    and is based on the reference implementation by O'Brein et al [1]

        This is a composition independent model for which the end-to-end distance depends
        solely on the number of amino acids. It is included here as an additional reference

        By default this uses a prefactor of 5.5 A (0.55 nanometers).

        Parameters
        ------------
        prefactor : float
            Prefactor is a number that tunes the SAW dimensions. 0.5 is in the right ballpark
            but this number should be tuned to match EV sims.

        Returns
        -------

        tuple of arrays
           A 2-pair tuple of numpy arrays where the first is the distance (in Angstroms) and 
           the second array is the probability of that distance.
